# [ info ]
  
Source code of Abyss Client that [maywr](https://github.com/maywr) obtained by deobfuscating it
  
Initially we wanted to remap the source and release a buildable version of it, but we quickly lost interest due to the client being shit and pasted (command system and mixins were taken from salhack, timer class was taken from old phobos and the loading screen was pasted from some noname 1.8 client)
  
Feel free to paste from this, not like anybody cares anyway
